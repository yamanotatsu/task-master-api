# Administrator Guide

This guide provides detailed information for Task Master administrators on managing organizations, users, and system configurations.

## Organization Administration

### Initial Setup

When setting up a new Task Master organization:

1. **Organization Creation**
   - Name your organization clearly and professionally
   - Add a meaningful description
   - Consider your naming convention if you plan to have multiple organizations

2. **First Admin Setup**
   - The user who creates the organization automatically becomes the first admin
   - This user has full control over the organization

### Member Management

#### Inviting New Members

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Members**
2. Click **"Invite Member"**
3. Enter the invitee's email address
4. Choose their role:
   - **Admin**: Can manage organization settings, invite/remove members, and access all projects
   - **Member**: Can create and manage projects/tasks but cannot change organization settings

#### Managing Existing Members

- View all members in the Members section
- Change member roles (admin only)
- Remove members when necessary
- Monitor member activity and last login times

### Invitation System Updates

The invitation system now supports:

- **Existing User Invitations**: Users with existing Task Master accounts can now be invited to join additional organizations
- **Multiple Organization Support**: Users can belong to multiple organizations simultaneously
- **Email-Based Verification**: Invitations are no longer restricted to new users only

#### How the New System Works

1. **For New Users**:
   - Send invitation → User signs up → Automatically joins organization
   
2. **For Existing Users**:
   - Send invitation → User logs in → Sees confirmation screen → Joins organization
   - The user's current organization preference is maintained

3. **Invitation Expiry**:
   - All invitations expire after 7 days
   - Expired invitations must be resent

## Security Best Practices

### Access Control

1. **Role Assignment**:
   - Limit admin roles to trusted personnel
   - Regularly audit admin access
   - Use the principle of least privilege

2. **Member Auditing**:
   - Periodically review member lists
   - Remove inactive users
   - Check for unauthorized access patterns

### Data Protection

1. **Project Visibility**:
   - All organization members can see all projects
   - Ensure sensitive projects are only created when necessary
   - Consider creating separate organizations for highly sensitive work

2. **API Security**:
   - API keys are organization-specific
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

## Common Administrative Tasks

### Onboarding New Team Members

1. **Prepare in Advance**:
   - Create a list of new members' email addresses
   - Decide on appropriate roles
   - Prepare any necessary documentation

2. **Bulk Invitations**:
   - Currently, invitations must be sent one at a time
   - Plan accordingly for large teams

3. **Follow-up**:
   - Monitor pending invitations
   - Resend expired invitations
   - Assist users with login issues

### Handling Departing Members

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove user from organization
   - Reassign their tasks to other team members
   - Document any ongoing work

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - User removal is immediate
   - They lose access to all organization resources
   - Consider changing sensitive information if necessary

### Organization Maintenance

1. **Regular Tasks**:
   - Review member list monthly
   - Check for unused projects
   - Archive completed projects
   - Monitor storage usage

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Archive old tasks
   - Clean up test projects
   - Maintain reasonable project counts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invitation Problems**:
   - **"Already a member" error**: User is already in the organization
   - **"Invalid invitation" error**: Invitation expired or already used
   - **Solution**: Check member list, resend invitation if needed

2. **Access Issues**:
   - Users can't see projects: Ensure they've selected the correct organization
   - Login problems: Verify email confirmation status
   - Permission errors: Check user role assignment

3. **Organization Switching**:
   - Users in multiple organizations must manually switch between them
   - Current organization preference is preserved per session
   - Guide users to the organization switcher in their profile menu

### API Management

1. **API Key Generation**:
   - Only admins can generate API keys
   - Keys are tied to the organization, not individual users
   - Store keys securely

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Monitor API usage to avoid rate limits
   - Implement appropriate backoff strategies
   - Contact support for limit increases if needed

## Advanced Configuration

### Webhook Setup

1. Configure webhooks for:
   - Task creation/updates
   - Member changes
   - Project events

2. Webhook security:
   - Verify webhook signatures
   - Use HTTPS endpoints only
   - Implement proper error handling

### Integration Management

1. **Third-party Integrations**:
   - Review connected applications
   - Audit integration permissions
   - Remove unused integrations

2. **Custom Integrations**:
   - Use API keys appropriately
   - Follow rate limiting guidelines
   - Implement proper error handling

## Compliance and Governance

### Data Retention

1. **Default Policies**:
   - Tasks are retained indefinitely
   - Deleted items are soft-deleted for 30 days
   - Audit logs retained for 90 days

2. **Custom Requirements**:
   - Contact support for custom retention policies
   - Export data regularly for compliance
   - Document your retention procedures

### Audit Trails

1. **What's Logged**:
   - All administrative actions
   - Member invitations and removals
   - Role changes
   - API key generation

2. **Accessing Logs**:
   - View in Settings → Audit Log
