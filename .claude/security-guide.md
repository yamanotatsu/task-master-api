# Claude Task Master Security Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in Claude Task Master to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain system integrity.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy

Claude Task Master implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Network Security**: Rate limiting, CORS policies
2. **Application Security**: Input validation, sanitization
3. **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT tokens, RBAC
4. **Data Security**: Encryption, RLS policies
5. **Audit & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging

## Authentication System

### Supabase Auth Integration

The system uses Supabase Auth for robust authentication:

```javascript
// Authentication flow
1. User registration with email verification
2. Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
3. JWT token generation
4. Session management
5. Token refresh mechanism
```

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
- Must contain numbers
- Special characters recommended
- Password strength indicator
- Password history (planned)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (Planned)

- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- SMS verification
- Email verification codes
- Backup codes

## Authorization System

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Two primary roles per organization:

1. **Admin**

   - Full organization management
   - Member management
   - Project deletion
   - Audit log access
   - Settings management

2. **Member**
   - View organization data
   - Create/manage projects
   - Create/manage tasks
   - Limited settings access

### Resource-Based Permissions

```javascript
// Permission checks
- Organization membership required
- Project access validation
- Task ownership verification
- Cascading permissions
```

## API Security

### Input Validation

All API inputs are validated using Zod schemas:

```javascript
// Example validation schema
const createTaskSchema = z.object({
	title: z.string().min(1).max(255),
	description: z.string().max(1000),
	projectId: z.string().uuid(),
	priority: z.enum(['high', 'medium', 'low'])
});
```

### Rate Limiting

Implemented per endpoint category:

- **Authentication**: 5 requests/minute
- **Password Reset**: 3 requests/hour
- **API General**: 1000 requests/hour
- **Audit Exports**: 10 requests/hour

### CORS Configuration

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
	origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(','),
	credentials: true,
	methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH'],
	allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
};
```

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- **At Rest**: Database encryption via Supabase
- **In Transit**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- **Sensitive Data**: Additional application-level encryption

### Row Level Security (RLS)

PostgreSQL RLS policies ensure data isolation:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their organization's data"
ON tasks
FOR SELECT
USING (organization_id IN (
  SELECT organization_id
  FROM organization_members
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
));
```

### Data Sanitization

- HTML sanitization for user inputs
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Security Middleware

### Helmet.js Configuration

```javascript
app.use(
	helmet({
		contentSecurityPolicy: {
			directives: {
				defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
				styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
				scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
				imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:']
			}
		},
		hsts: {
			maxAge: 31536000,
			includeSubDomains: true,
			preload: true
		}
	})
);
```

### Security Headers

- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy

## Audit Logging

### Logged Events

All security-relevant events are logged:

- User authentication (login/logout)
- Failed login attempts
- Permission changes
- Data modifications
- API access patterns
- Security incidents

### Audit Log Schema

```javascript
{
  id: UUID,
  organization_id: UUID,
  user_id: UUID,
  action: string,
  resource_type: string,
  resource_id: string,
  details: {
    ip_address: string,
    user_agent: string,
    method: string,
    path: string,
    status_code: number,
    risk_level: string
  },
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

## Brute Force Protection

### Failed Login Tracking

```javascript
// Protection mechanism
1. Track failed attempts by email + IP
2. Exponential backoff (1, 2, 4, 8... minutes)
3. Account lockout after 5 attempts
4. CAPTCHA requirement after 3 attempts
5. IP-based blocking for severe cases
```

### CAPTCHA Integration

- Google reCAPTCHA v3
- Invisible challenges
- Risk-based activation
- Fallback mechanisms

## Session Management

### JWT Token Security

- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Longer refresh tokens (7 days)
- Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies)
- Token rotation on refresh
- Blacklist for revoked tokens

### Session Policies

- Automatic logout on inactivity
- Session invalidation on password change
- Device tracking and management
- Concurrent session limits (planned)

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning

- Automated dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- npm audit on CI/CD
- Snyk integration (planned)

### Security Testing

- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Penetration testing (quarterly)
