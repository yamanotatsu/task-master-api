# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a flexible logging system with configurable levels and output formats.
# Details:
Implement logging system including:
- Multiple log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Configurable output destinations
- Command execution logging
- API interaction logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Log file rotation

# Test Strategy:
Test logging at different verbosity levels. Verify that logs contain appropriate information for debugging. Test log file rotation with large volumes of logs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Logging Framework with Log Levels [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a modular logging framework that supports multiple log levels (debug, info, warn, error). Implement a Logger class that handles message formatting, timestamp addition, and log level filtering. The framework should allow for global log level configuration through the configuration system and provide a clean API for logging messages at different levels.

## 2. Implement Configurable Output Destinations [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Extend the logging framework to support multiple output destinations simultaneously. Implement adapters for console output, file output, and potentially other destinations (like remote logging services). Create a configuration system that allows specifying which log levels go to which destinations. Ensure thread-safe writing to prevent log corruption.

## 3. Implement Command and API Interaction Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Create specialized logging functionality for command execution and API interactions. For commands, log the command name, arguments, options, and execution status. For API interactions, log request details (URL, method, headers), response status, and timing information. Implement sanitization to prevent logging sensitive data like API keys or passwords.
### Details:


## 4. Implement Error Tracking and Performance Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Enhance the logging system to provide detailed error tracking and performance metrics. For errors, capture stack traces, error codes, and contextual information. For performance metrics, implement timing utilities to measure execution duration of key operations. Create a consistent format for these specialized log types to enable easier analysis.
### Details:


## 5. Implement Log File Rotation and Management [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Create a log file management system that handles rotation based on file size or time intervals. Implement compression of rotated logs, automatic cleanup of old logs, and configurable retention policies. Ensure that log rotation happens without disrupting the application and that no log messages are lost during rotation.
