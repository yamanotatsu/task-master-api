# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Batch Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality for performing operations on multiple tasks simultaneously.
# Details:
Create batch operations including:
- Implement multi-task status updates
- Add bulk subtask generation
- Create task filtering and querying capabilities
- Implement advanced dependency management
- Add batch prioritization
- Create commands for operating on filtered task sets

# Test Strategy:
Test batch operations with various filters and operations. Verify that operations are applied correctly to all matching tasks. Test with large task sets to ensure performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Multi-Task Status Update Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Create a command-line interface command that allows users to update the status of multiple tasks simultaneously. Implement the backend logic to process batch status changes, validate the requested changes, and update the tasks.json file accordingly. The implementation should include options for filtering tasks by various criteria (ID ranges, status, priority, etc.) and applying status changes to the filtered set.
### Details:


## 2. Develop Bulk Subtask Generation System [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Create functionality to generate multiple subtasks across several parent tasks at once. This should include a command-line interface that accepts filtering parameters to select parent tasks and either a template for subtasks or an AI-assisted generation option. The system should validate parent tasks, generate appropriate subtasks with proper ID assignments, and update the tasks.json file.
### Details:


## 3. Implement Advanced Task Filtering and Querying [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust filtering and querying system that can be used across all batch operations. Implement a query syntax that allows for complex filtering based on task properties, including status, priority, dependencies, ID ranges, and text search within titles and descriptions. Design the system to be reusable across different batch operation commands.
### Details:


## 4. Create Advanced Dependency Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Implement batch operations for managing dependencies between tasks. This includes commands for adding, removing, and updating dependencies across multiple tasks simultaneously. The system should validate dependency changes to prevent circular dependencies, update the tasks.json file, and regenerate task files to reflect the changes.
### Details:


## 5. Implement Batch Task Prioritization and Command System [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Create a system for batch prioritization of tasks and a command framework for operating on filtered task sets. This includes commands for changing priorities of multiple tasks at once and a generic command execution system that can apply custom operations to filtered task sets. The implementation should include a plugin architecture that allows for extending the system with new batch operations.
