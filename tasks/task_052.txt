# Task ID: 52
# Title: Implement Task Suggestion Command for CLI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a new CLI command 'suggest-task' that generates contextually relevant task suggestions based on existing tasks and allows users to accept, decline, or regenerate suggestions.
# Details:
Implement a new command 'suggest-task' that can be invoked from the CLI to generate intelligent task suggestions. The command should:

1. Collect a snapshot of all existing tasks including their titles, descriptions, statuses, and dependencies
2. Extract parent task subtask titles (not full objects) to provide context
3. Use this information to generate a contextually appropriate new task suggestion
4. Present the suggestion to the user in a clear format
5. Provide an interactive interface with options to:
   - Accept the suggestion (creating a new task with the suggested details)
   - Decline the suggestion (exiting without creating a task)
   - Regenerate a new suggestion (requesting an alternative)

The implementation should follow a similar pattern to the 'generate-subtask' command but operate at the task level rather than subtask level. The command should use the project's existing AI integration to analyze the current task structure and generate relevant suggestions. Ensure proper error handling for API failures and implement a timeout mechanism for suggestion generation.

The command should accept optional flags to customize the suggestion process, such as:
- `--parent=<task-id>` to suggest a task related to a specific parent task
- `--type=<task-type>` to suggest a specific type of task (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
- `--context=<additional-context>` to provide additional information for the suggestion

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and user experience of the suggest-task command:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test the task collection mechanism to ensure it correctly gathers existing task data
   - Test the context extraction logic to verify it properly isolates relevant subtask titles
   - Test the suggestion generation with mocked AI responses
   - Test the command's parsing of various flag combinations

2. Integration tests:
   - Test the end-to-end flow with a mock project structure
   - Verify the command correctly interacts with the AI service
   - Test the task creation process when a suggestion is accepted

3. User interaction tests:
   - Test the accept/decline/regenerate interface works correctly
   - Verify appropriate feedback is displayed to the user
   - Test handling of unexpected user inputs

4. Edge cases:
   - Test behavior when run in an empty project with no existing tasks
   - Test with malformed task data
   - Test with API timeouts or failures
   - Test with extremely large numbers of existing tasks

Manually verify the command produces contextually appropriate suggestions that align with the project's current state and needs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design data collection mechanism for existing tasks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module to collect and format existing task data from the system for AI processing
### Details:
Implement a function that retrieves all existing tasks from storage, formats them appropriately for AI context, and handles edge cases like empty task lists or corrupted data. Include metadata like task status, dependencies, and creation dates to provide rich context for suggestions.

## 2. Implement AI integration for task suggestions [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.1
### Description: Develop the core functionality to generate task suggestions using AI based on existing tasks
### Details:
Create an AI prompt template that effectively communicates the existing task context and request for suggestions. Implement error handling for API failures, rate limiting, and malformed responses. Include parameters for controlling suggestion quantity and specificity.

## 3. Build interactive CLI interface for suggestions [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.2
### Description: Create the command-line interface for requesting and displaying task suggestions
### Details:
Design a user-friendly CLI command structure with appropriate flags for customization. Implement progress indicators during AI processing and format the output of suggestions in a clear, readable format. Include help text and examples in the command documentation.

## 4. Implement suggestion selection and task creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.3
### Description: Allow users to interactively select suggestions to convert into actual tasks
### Details:
Create an interactive selection interface where users can review suggestions, select which ones to create as tasks, and optionally modify them before creation. Implement batch creation capabilities and validation to ensure new tasks meet system requirements.

## 5. Add configuration options and flag handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 52.3, 52.4
### Description: Implement various configuration options and command flags for customizing suggestion behavior
### Details:
Create a comprehensive set of command flags for controlling suggestion quantity, specificity, format, and other parameters. Implement persistent configuration options that users can set as defaults. Document all available options and provide examples of common usage patterns.
