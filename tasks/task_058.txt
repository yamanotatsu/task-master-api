# Task ID: 58
# Title: Implement Elegant Package Update Mechanism for Task-Master
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a robust update mechanism that handles package updates gracefully, ensuring all necessary files are updated when the global package is upgraded.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive update system with these components:

1. **Update Detection**: When task-master runs, check if the current version matches the installed version. If not, notify the user an update is available.

2. **Update Command**: Implement a dedicated `task-master update` command that:
   - Updates the global package (`npm -g task-master-ai@latest`)
   - Automatically runs necessary initialization steps
   - Preserves user configurations while updating system files

3. **Smart File Management**:
   - Create a manifest of core files with checksums
   - During updates, compare existing files with the manifest
   - Only overwrite files that have changed in the update
   - Preserve user-modified files with an option to merge changes

4. **Configuration Versioning**:
   - Add version tracking to configuration files
   - Implement migration paths for configuration changes between versions
   - Provide backward compatibility for older configurations

5. **Update Notifications**:
   - Add a non-intrusive notification when updates are available
   - Include a changelog summary of what's new

This system should work seamlessly with the existing `task-master init` command but provide a more automated and user-friendly update experience.

# Test Strategy:
Test the update mechanism with these specific scenarios:

1. **Version Detection Test**:
   - Install an older version, then verify the system correctly detects when a newer version is available
   - Test with minor and major version changes

2. **Update Command Test**:
   - Verify `task-master update` successfully updates the global package
   - Confirm all necessary files are updated correctly
   - Test with and without user-modified files present

3. **File Preservation Test**:
   - Modify configuration files, then update
   - Verify user changes are preserved while system files are updated
   - Test with conflicts between user changes and system updates

4. **Rollback Test**:
   - Implement and test a rollback mechanism if updates fail
   - Verify system returns to previous working state

5. **Integration Test**:
   - Create a test project with the current version
   - Run through the update process
   - Verify all functionality continues to work after update

6. **Edge Case Tests**:
   - Test updating with insufficient permissions
   - Test updating with network interruptions
   - Test updating from very old versions to latest
