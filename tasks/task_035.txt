# Task ID: 35
# Title: Integrate Grok3 API for Research Capabilities
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace the current Perplexity API integration with Grok3 API for all research-related functionalities while maintaining existing feature parity.
# Details:
This task involves migrating from Perplexity to Grok3 API for research capabilities throughout the application. Implementation steps include:

1. Create a new API client module for Grok3 in `src/api/grok3.ts` that handles authentication, request formatting, and response parsing
2. Update the research service layer to use the new Grok3 client instead of Perplexity
3. Modify the request payload structure to match Grok3's expected format (parameters like temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
4. Update response handling to properly parse and extract Grok3's response format
5. Implement proper error handling for Grok3-specific error codes and messages
6. Update environment variables and configuration files to include Grok3 API keys and endpoints
7. Ensure rate limiting and quota management are properly implemented according to Grok3's specifications
8. Update any UI components that display research provider information to show Grok3 instead of Perplexity
9. Maintain backward compatibility for any stored research results from Perplexity
10. Document the new API integration in the developer documentation

Grok3 API has different parameter requirements and response formats compared to Perplexity, so careful attention must be paid to these differences during implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that the Grok3 API integration works correctly and maintains feature parity with the previous Perplexity implementation:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test the Grok3 API client with mocked responses
   - Verify proper error handling for various error scenarios (rate limits, authentication failures, etc.)
   - Test the transformation of application requests to Grok3-compatible format

2. Integration tests:
   - Perform actual API calls to Grok3 with test credentials
   - Verify that research results are correctly parsed and returned
   - Test with various types of research queries to ensure broad compatibility

3. End-to-end tests:
   - Test the complete research flow from UI input to displayed results
   - Verify that all existing research features work with the new API

4. Performance tests:
   - Compare response times between Perplexity and Grok3
   - Ensure the application handles any differences in response time appropriately

5. Regression tests:
   - Verify that existing features dependent on research capabilities continue to work
   - Test that stored research results from Perplexity are still accessible and displayed correctly

Create a test environment with both APIs available to compare results and ensure quality before fully replacing Perplexity with Grok3.
