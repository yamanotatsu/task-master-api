# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Cursor Rules Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Cursor AI integration rules and documentation.
# Details:
Implement Cursor rules including:
- Create dev_workflow.mdc documentation
- Implement cursor_rules.mdc
- Add self_improve.mdc
- Design rule integration documentation
- Set up .cursor directory structure
- Document how Cursor AI should interact with the system

# Test Strategy:
Review rules documentation for clarity and completeness. Test with Cursor AI to verify the rules are properly interpreted and followed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up .cursor Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the required directory structure for Cursor AI integration, including the .cursor folder and rules subfolder. This provides the foundation for storing all Cursor-related configuration files and rule documentation. Ensure proper permissions and gitignore settings are configured to maintain these files correctly.
### Details:


## 2. Create dev_workflow.mdc Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop the dev_workflow.mdc file that documents the development workflow for Cursor AI. This file should outline how Cursor AI should assist with task discovery, implementation, and verification within the project. Include specific examples of commands and interactions that demonstrate the optimal workflow.
### Details:


## 3. Implement cursor_rules.mdc [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create the cursor_rules.mdc file that defines specific rules and guidelines for how Cursor AI should interact with the codebase. This should include code style preferences, architectural patterns to follow, documentation requirements, and any project-specific conventions that Cursor AI should adhere to when generating or modifying code.
### Details:


## 4. Add self_improve.mdc Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Develop the self_improve.mdc file that instructs Cursor AI on how to continuously improve its assistance capabilities within the project context. This document should outline how Cursor AI should learn from feedback, adapt to project evolution, and enhance its understanding of the codebase over time.
### Details:


## 5. Create Cursor AI Integration Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation on how Cursor AI integrates with the task management system. This should include detailed instructions on how Cursor AI should interpret tasks.json, individual task files, and how it should assist with implementation. Document the specific commands and workflows that Cursor AI should understand and support.
