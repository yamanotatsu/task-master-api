# Task ID: 57
# Title: Enhance Task-Master CLI User Experience and Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the Task-Master CLI's user experience by refining the interface, reducing verbose logging, and adding visual polish to create a more professional and intuitive tool.
# Details:
The current Task-Master CLI interface is functional but lacks polish and produces excessive log output. This task involves several key improvements:

1. Log Management:
   - Implement log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
   - Only show INFO and above by default
   - Add a --verbose flag to show all logs
   - Create a dedicated log file for detailed logs

2. Visual Enhancements:
   - Add a clean, branded header when the tool starts
   - Implement color-coding for different types of messages (success in green, errors in red, etc.)
   - Use spinners or progress indicators for operations that take time
   - Add clear visual separation between command input and output

3. Interactive Elements:
   - Add loading animations for longer operations
   - Implement interactive prompts for complex inputs instead of requiring all parameters upfront
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

4. Output Formatting:
   - Format task listings in tables with consistent spacing
   - Implement a compact mode and a detailed mode for viewing tasks
   - Add visual indicators for task status (icons or colors)

5. Help and Documentation:
   - Enhance help text with examples and clearer descriptions
   - Add contextual hints for common next steps after commands

Use libraries like chalk, ora, inquirer, and boxen to implement these improvements. Ensure the interface remains functional in CI/CD environments where interactive elements might not be supported.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and user experience improvements:

1. Automated Tests:
   - Create unit tests for log level filtering functionality
   - Test that all commands still function correctly with the new UI
   - Verify that non-interactive mode works in CI environments
   - Test that verbose and quiet modes function as expected

2. User Experience Testing:
   - Create a test script that runs through common user flows
   - Capture before/after screenshots for visual comparison
   - Measure and compare the number of lines output for common operations

3. Usability Testing:
   - Have 3-5 team members perform specific tasks using the new interface
   - Collect feedback on clarity, ease of use, and visual appeal
   - Identify any confusion points or areas for improvement

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test in terminals with different color schemes and sizes
   - Verify functionality in environments without color support
   - Test with very large task lists to ensure formatting remains clean

Acceptance Criteria:
- Log output is reduced by at least 50% in normal operation
- All commands provide clear visual feedback about their progress and completion
- Help text is comprehensive and includes examples
- Interface is visually consistent across all commands
- Tool remains fully functional in non-interactive environments

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Configurable Log Levels [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a logging system with different verbosity levels that users can configure
### Details:
Design and implement a logging system with at least 4 levels (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG). Add command-line options to set the verbosity level. Ensure logs are color-coded by severity and can be redirected to files. Include timestamp formatting options.

## 2. Design Terminal Color Scheme and Visual Elements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a consistent and accessible color scheme for the CLI interface
### Details:
Define a color palette that works across different terminal environments. Implement color-coding for different task states, priorities, and command categories. Add support for terminals without color capabilities. Design visual separators, headers, and footers for different output sections.

## 3. Implement Progress Indicators and Loading Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.2
### Description: Add visual feedback for long-running operations
### Details:
Create spinner animations for operations that take time to complete. Implement progress bars for operations with known completion percentages. Ensure animations degrade gracefully in terminals with limited capabilities. Add estimated time remaining calculations where possible.

## 4. Develop Interactive Selection Menus [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.2
### Description: Create interactive menus for task selection and configuration
### Details:
Implement arrow-key navigation for selecting tasks from a list. Add checkbox and radio button interfaces for multi-select and single-select options. Include search/filter functionality for large task lists. Ensure keyboard shortcuts are consistent and documented.

## 5. Design Tabular and Structured Output Formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.2
### Description: Improve the formatting of task lists and detailed information
### Details:
Create table layouts with proper column alignment for task lists. Implement tree views for displaying task hierarchies and dependencies. Add support for different output formats (plain text, JSON, CSV). Ensure outputs are properly paginated for large datasets.

## 6. Create Help System and Interactive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.2, 57.4, 57.5
### Description: Develop an in-CLI help system with examples and contextual assistance
### Details:
Implement a comprehensive help command with examples for each feature. Add contextual help that suggests relevant commands based on user actions. Create interactive tutorials for new users. Include command auto-completion suggestions and syntax highlighting for command examples.
