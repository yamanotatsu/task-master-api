# Task ID: 63
# Title: Add pnpm Support for the Taskmaster Package
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement full support for pnpm as an alternative package manager in the Taskmaster application, ensuring users have the exact same experience as with npm when installing and managing the package. The installation process, including any CLI prompts or web interfaces, must serve the exact same content and user experience regardless of whether npm or pnpm is used. The project uses 'module' as the package type, defines binaries 'task-master' and 'task-master-mcp', and its core logic resides in 'scripts/modules/'. The 'init' command (via scripts/init.js) creates the directory structure (.cursor/rules, scripts, tasks), copies templates (.env.example, .gitignore, rule files, dev.js), manages package.json merging, and sets up MCP config (.cursor/mcp.json). All dependencies are standard npm dependencies listed in package.json, and manual modifications are being removed.
# Details:
This task involves:

1. Update the installation documentation to include pnpm installation commands (e.g., `pnpm add taskmaster`).

2. Ensure all package scripts are compatible with pnpm's execution model:
   - Review and modify package.json scripts if necessary
   - Test script execution with pnpm syntax (`pnpm run <script>`)
   - Address any pnpm-specific path or execution differences
   - Confirm that scripts responsible for showing a website or prompt during install behave identically with pnpm and npm

3. Create a pnpm-lock.yaml file by installing dependencies with pnpm.

4. Test the application's installation and operation when installed via pnpm:
   - Global installation (`pnpm add -g taskmaster`)
   - Local project installation
   - Verify CLI commands work correctly when installed with pnpm
   - Verify binaries `task-master` and `task-master-mcp` are properly linked
   - Ensure the `init` command (scripts/init.js) correctly creates directory structure and copies templates as described

5. Update CI/CD pipelines to include testing with pnpm:
   - Add a pnpm test matrix to GitHub Actions workflows
   - Ensure tests pass when dependencies are installed with pnpm

6. Handle any pnpm-specific dependency resolution issues:
   - Address potential hoisting differences between npm and pnpm
   - Test with pnpm's strict mode to ensure compatibility
   - Verify proper handling of 'module' package type

7. Document any pnpm-specific considerations or commands in the README and documentation.

8. Verify that the `scripts/init.js` file works correctly with pnpm:
   - Ensure it properly creates `.cursor/rules`, `scripts`, and `tasks` directories
   - Verify template copying (`.env.example`, `.gitignore`, rule files, `dev.js`)
   - Confirm `package.json` merging works correctly
   - Test MCP config setup (`.cursor/mcp.json`)

9. Ensure core logic in `scripts/modules/` works correctly when installed via pnpm.

This implementation should maintain full feature parity and identical user experience regardless of which package manager is used to install Taskmaster.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual Testing:
   - Install Taskmaster globally using pnpm: `pnpm add -g taskmaster`
   - Install Taskmaster locally in a test project: `pnpm add taskmaster`
   - Verify all CLI commands function correctly with both installation methods
   - Test all major features to ensure they work identically to npm installations
   - Verify binaries `task-master` and `task-master-mcp` are properly linked and executable
   - Test the `init` command to ensure it correctly sets up the directory structure and files as defined in scripts/init.js

2. Automated Testing:
   - Create a dedicated test workflow in GitHub Actions that uses pnpm
   - Run the full test suite using pnpm to install dependencies
   - Verify all tests pass with the same results as npm

3. Documentation Testing:
   - Review all documentation to ensure pnpm commands are correctly documented
   - Verify installation instructions work as written
   - Test any pnpm-specific instructions or notes

4. Compatibility Testing:
   - Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Verify compatibility with different pnpm versions (latest stable and LTS)
   - Test in environments with multiple package managers installed
   - Verify proper handling of 'module' package type

5. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test installation in a project that uses pnpm workspaces
   - Verify behavior when upgrading from an npm installation to pnpm
   - Test with pnpm's various flags and modes (--frozen-lockfile, --strict-peer-dependencies)

6. Performance Comparison:
   - Measure and document any performance differences between package managers
   - Compare installation times and disk space usage

7. Structure Testing:
   - Verify that the core logic in `scripts/modules/` is accessible and functions correctly
   - Confirm that the `init` command properly creates all required directories and files as per scripts/init.js
   - Test package.json merging functionality
   - Verify MCP config setup

Success criteria: Taskmaster should install and function identically regardless of whether it was installed via npm or pnpm, with no degradation in functionality, performance, or user experience. All binaries should be properly linked, and the directory structure should be correctly created.
