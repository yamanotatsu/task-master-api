# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement ICE Analysis Command for Task Prioritization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a new command that analyzes and ranks tasks based on Impact, Confidence, and Ease (ICE) scoring methodology, generating a comprehensive prioritization report.
# Details:
Develop a new command called `analyze-ice` that evaluates non-completed tasks (excluding those marked as done, cancelled, or deferred) and ranks them according to the ICE methodology:

1. Core functionality:
   - Calculate an Impact score (how much value the task will deliver)
   - Calculate a Confidence score (how certain we are about the impact)
   - Calculate an Ease score (how easy it is to implement)
   - Compute a total ICE score (sum or product of the three components)

2. Implementation details:
   - Reuse the filtering logic from `analyze-complexity` to select relevant tasks
   - Leverage the LLM to generate scores for each dimension on a scale of 1-10
   - For each task, prompt the LLM to evaluate and justify each score based on task description and details
   - Create an `ice_report.md` file similar to the complexity report
   - Sort tasks by total ICE score in descending order

3. CLI rendering:
   - Implement a sister command `show-ice-report` that displays the report in the terminal
   - Format the output with colorized scores and rankings
   - Include options to sort by individual components (impact, confidence, or ease)

4. Integration:
   - If a complexity report exists, reference it in the ICE report for additional context
   - Consider adding a combined view that shows both complexity and ICE scores

The command should follow the same design patterns as `analyze-complexity` for consistency and code reuse.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests:
   - Test the ICE scoring algorithm with various mock task inputs
   - Verify correct filtering of tasks based on status
   - Test the sorting functionality with different ranking criteria

2. Integration tests:
   - Create a test project with diverse tasks and verify the generated ICE report
   - Test the integration with existing complexity reports
   - Verify that changes to task statuses correctly update the ICE analysis

3. CLI tests:
   - Verify the `analyze-ice` command generates the expected report file
   - Test the `show-ice-report` command renders correctly in the terminal
   - Test with various flag combinations and sorting options

4. Validation criteria:
   - The ICE scores should be reasonable and consistent
   - The report should clearly explain the rationale behind each score
   - The ranking should prioritize high-impact, high-confidence, easy-to-implement tasks
   - Performance should be acceptable even with a large number of tasks
   - The command should handle edge cases gracefully (empty projects, missing data)

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design ICE scoring algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the algorithm for calculating Impact, Confidence, and Ease scores for tasks
### Details:
Define the mathematical formula for ICE scoring (Impact × Confidence × Ease). Determine the scale for each component (e.g., 1-10). Create rules for how AI will evaluate each component based on task attributes like complexity, dependencies, and descriptions. Document the scoring methodology for future reference.

## 2. Implement AI integration for ICE scoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.1
### Description: Develop the AI component that will analyze tasks and generate ICE scores
### Details:
Create prompts for the AI to evaluate Impact, Confidence, and Ease. Implement error handling for AI responses. Add caching to prevent redundant AI calls. Ensure the AI provides justification for each score component. Test with various task types to ensure consistent scoring.

## 3. Create report file generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.2
### Description: Build functionality to generate a structured report file with ICE analysis results
### Details:
Design the report file format (JSON, CSV, or Markdown). Implement sorting of tasks by ICE score. Include task details, individual I/C/E scores, and final ICE score in the report. Add timestamp and project metadata. Create a function to save the report to the specified location.

## 4. Implement CLI rendering for ICE analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.3
### Description: Develop the command-line interface for displaying ICE analysis results
### Details:
Design a tabular format for displaying ICE scores in the terminal. Use color coding to highlight high/medium/low priority tasks. Implement filtering options (by score range, task type, etc.). Add sorting capabilities. Create a summary view that shows top N tasks by ICE score.

## 5. Integrate with existing complexity reports [pending]
### Dependencies: 46.3, 46.4
### Description: Connect the ICE analysis functionality with the existing complexity reporting system
### Details:
Modify the existing complexity report to include ICE scores. Ensure consistent formatting between complexity and ICE reports. Add cross-referencing between reports. Update the command-line help documentation. Test the integrated system with various project sizes and configurations.
