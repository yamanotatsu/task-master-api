# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Task Expansion with Claude
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to expand tasks into subtasks using Claude's AI capabilities.
# Details:
Build task expansion functionality including:
- Create subtask generation prompts
- Implement workflow for expanding a task into subtasks
- Add context-aware expansion capabilities
- Implement parent-child relationship management
- Allow specification of number of subtasks to generate
- Provide mechanism to regenerate unsatisfactory subtasks

# Test Strategy:
Test expanding various types of tasks into subtasks. Verify that subtasks are properly linked to parent tasks. Check that context is properly incorporated into generated subtasks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Subtask Generation Prompts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create optimized prompt templates for Claude to generate subtasks from parent tasks. Design the prompts to include task context, project information, and formatting instructions that ensure consistent, high-quality subtask generation. Implement a prompt template system that allows for dynamic insertion of task details, configurable number of subtasks, and additional context parameters.
### Details:


## 2. Develop Task Expansion Workflow and UI [done]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Implement the command-line interface and workflow for expanding tasks into subtasks. Create a new command that allows users to select a task, specify the number of subtasks, and add optional context. Design the interaction flow to handle the API request, process the response, and update the tasks.json file with the newly generated subtasks.
### Details:


## 3. Implement Context-Aware Expansion Capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Enhance the task expansion functionality to incorporate project context when generating subtasks. Develop a system to gather relevant information from the project, such as related tasks, dependencies, and previously completed work. Implement logic to include this context in the Claude prompts to improve the relevance and quality of generated subtasks.
### Details:


## 4. Build Parent-Child Relationship Management [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement the data structure and operations for managing parent-child relationships between tasks and subtasks. Create functions to establish these relationships in the tasks.json file, update the task model to support subtask arrays, and develop utilities to navigate, filter, and display task hierarchies. Ensure all basic task operations (update, delete, etc.) properly handle subtask relationships.
### Details:


## 5. Implement Subtask Regeneration Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.4
### Description: Create functionality that allows users to regenerate unsatisfactory subtasks. Implement a command that can target specific subtasks for regeneration, preserve satisfactory subtasks, and incorporate feedback to improve the new generation. Design the system to maintain proper parent-child relationships and task IDs during regeneration.
