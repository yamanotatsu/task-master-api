# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Agent Integration with Cursor and dev.js Commands
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Document and enhance existing agent interaction patterns through Cursor rules and dev.js commands.
# Details:
Optimize agent integration including:
- Document and improve existing agent interaction patterns in Cursor rules
- Enhance integration between Cursor agent capabilities and dev.js commands
- Improve agent workflow documentation in cursor rules (dev_workflow.mdc, cursor_rules.mdc)
- Add missing agent-specific features to existing commands
- Leverage existing infrastructure rather than building a separate system

# Test Strategy:
Test the enhanced commands with AI agents to verify they can correctly interpret and use them. Verify that agents can effectively interact with the task system using the documented patterns in Cursor rules.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Existing Agent Interaction Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and document the current agent interaction patterns in Cursor rules (dev_workflow.mdc, cursor_rules.mdc). Create comprehensive documentation that explains how agents should interact with the task system using existing commands and patterns.
### Details:


## 2. Enhance Integration Between Cursor Agents and dev.js Commands [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve the integration between Cursor's built-in agent capabilities and the dev.js command system. Ensure that agents can effectively use all task management commands and that the command outputs are optimized for agent consumption.
### Details:


## 3. Optimize Command Responses for Agent Consumption [done]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Refine the output format of existing commands to ensure they are easily parseable by AI agents. Focus on consistent, structured outputs that agents can reliably interpret without requiring a separate parsing system.
### Details:


## 4. Improve Agent Workflow Documentation in Cursor Rules [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3
### Description: Enhance the agent workflow documentation in dev_workflow.mdc and cursor_rules.mdc to provide clear guidance on how agents should interact with the task system. Include example interactions and best practices for agents.
### Details:


## 5. Add Agent-Specific Features to Existing Commands [done]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Identify and implement any missing agent-specific features in the existing command system. This may include additional flags, parameters, or output formats that are particularly useful for agent interactions.
### Details:


## 6. Create Agent Usage Examples and Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Develop a set of example interactions and usage patterns that demonstrate how agents should effectively use the task system. Include these examples in the documentation to guide future agent implementations.
