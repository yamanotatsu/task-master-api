# Task ID: 47
# Title: Enhance Task Suggestion Actions Card Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign the suggestion actions card to implement a structured workflow for task expansion, subtask creation, context addition, and task management.
# Details:
Implement a new workflow for the suggestion actions card that guides users through a logical sequence when working with tasks and subtasks:

1. Task Expansion Phase:
   - Add a prominent 'Expand Task' button at the top of the suggestion card
   - Implement an 'Add Subtask' button that becomes active after task expansion
   - Allow users to add multiple subtasks sequentially
   - Provide visual indication of the current phase (expansion phase)

2. Context Addition Phase:
   - After subtasks are created, transition to the context phase
   - Implement an 'Update Subtask' action that allows appending context to each subtask
   - Create a UI element showing which subtask is currently being updated
   - Provide a progress indicator showing which subtasks have received context
   - Include a mechanism to navigate between subtasks for context addition

3. Task Management Phase:
   - Once all subtasks have context, enable the 'Set as In Progress' button
   - Add a 'Start Working' button that directs the agent to begin with the first subtask
   - Implement an 'Update Task' action that consolidates all notes and reorganizes them into improved subtask details
   - Provide a confirmation dialog when restructuring task content

4. UI/UX Considerations:
   - Use visual cues (colors, icons) to indicate the current phase
   - Implement tooltips explaining each action's purpose
   - Add a progress tracker showing completion status across all phases
   - Ensure the UI adapts responsively to different screen sizes

The implementation should maintain all existing functionality while guiding users through this more structured approach to task management.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the complete workflow functions correctly:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test each button/action individually to ensure it performs its specific function
   - Verify state transitions between phases work correctly
   - Test edge cases (e.g., attempting to set a task in progress before adding context)

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify the complete workflow from task expansion to starting work
   - Test that context added to subtasks is properly saved and displayed
   - Ensure the 'Update Task' functionality correctly consolidates and restructures content

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify visual indicators correctly show the current phase
   - Test responsive design on various screen sizes
   - Ensure tooltips and help text are displayed correctly

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios covering the complete workflow:
     a. Expand a task and add 3 subtasks
     b. Add context to each subtask
     c. Set the task as in progress
     d. Use update-task to restructure the content
     e. Verify the agent correctly begins work on the first subtask
   - Test with both simple and complex tasks to ensure scalability

5. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that existing functionality continues to work
   - Ensure compatibility with keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Task Expansion UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create UI components for the expanded task suggestion actions card that allow for task breakdown and additional context input.
### Details:
Design mockups for expanded card view, including subtask creation interface, context input fields, and task management controls. Ensure the design is consistent with existing UI patterns and responsive across different screen sizes. Include animations for card expansion/collapse.

## 2. Implement State Management for Task Expansion [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1
### Description: Develop the state management logic to handle expanded task states, subtask creation, and context additions.
### Details:
Create state handlers for expanded/collapsed states, subtask array management, and context data. Implement proper validation for user inputs and error handling. Ensure state persistence across user sessions and synchronization with backend services.

## 3. Build Context Addition Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.2
### Description: Create the functionality that allows users to add additional context to tasks and subtasks.
### Details:
Implement context input fields with support for rich text, attachments, links, and references to other tasks. Add auto-save functionality for context changes and version history if applicable. Include context suggestion features based on task content.

## 4. Develop Task Management Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.2
### Description: Implement controls for managing tasks within the expanded card view, including prioritization, scheduling, and assignment.
### Details:
Create UI controls for task prioritization (drag-and-drop ranking), deadline setting with calendar integration, assignee selection with user search, and status updates. Implement notification triggers for task changes and deadline reminders.

## 5. Integrate with Existing Task Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.3, 47.4
### Description: Ensure the enhanced actions card workflow integrates seamlessly with existing task management functionality.
### Details:
Connect the new UI components to existing backend APIs. Update data models if necessary to support new features. Ensure compatibility with existing task filters, search, and reporting features. Implement data migration plan for existing tasks if needed.

## 6. Test and Optimize User Experience [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.5
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of the enhanced workflow and optimize based on user feedback and performance metrics.
### Details:
Perform usability testing with representative users. Collect metrics on task completion time, error rates, and user satisfaction. Optimize performance for large task lists and complex subtask hierarchies. Implement A/B testing for alternative UI approaches if needed.
