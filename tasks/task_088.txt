# Task ID: 88
# Title: Enhance Add-Task Functionality to Consider All Task Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the add-task feature to accurately account for all dependencies among tasks, ensuring proper task ordering and execution.
# Details:
1. Review current implementation of add-task functionality.
2. Identify existing mechanisms for handling task dependencies.
3. Modify add-task to recursively analyze and incorporate all dependencies.
4. Ensure that dependencies are resolved in the correct order during task execution.
5. Update documentation to reflect changes in dependency handling.
6. Consider edge cases such as circular dependencies and handle them appropriately.
7. Optimize performance to ensure efficient dependency resolution, especially for projects with a large number of tasks.
8. Integrate with existing validation and error handling mechanisms (from Task 87) to provide clear feedback if dependencies cannot be resolved.
9. Test thoroughly with various dependency scenarios to ensure robustness.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create test cases with simple linear dependencies to verify correct ordering.
2. Develop test cases with complex, nested dependencies to ensure recursive resolution works correctly.
3. Include tests for edge cases such as circular dependencies, verifying appropriate error messages are displayed.
4. Measure performance with large sets of tasks and dependencies to ensure efficiency.
5. Conduct integration testing with other components that rely on task dependencies.
6. Perform manual code reviews to validate implementation against requirements.
7. Execute automated tests to verify no regressions in existing functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review Current Add-Task Implementation and Identify Dependency Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the existing add-task functionality to understand how task dependencies are currently handled.
### Details:
Conduct a code review of the add-task feature. Document any existing mechanisms for handling task dependencies.

## 2. Modify Add-Task to Recursively Analyze Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 88.1
### Description: Update the add-task functionality to recursively analyze and incorporate all task dependencies.
### Details:
Implement a recursive algorithm that identifies and incorporates all dependencies for a given task. Ensure it handles nested dependencies correctly.

## 3. Ensure Correct Order of Dependency Resolution [done]
### Dependencies: 88.2
### Description: Modify the add-task functionality to ensure that dependencies are resolved in the correct order during task execution.
### Details:
Implement logic to sort and execute tasks based on their dependency order. Handle cases where multiple tasks depend on each other.

## 4. Integrate with Existing Validation and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 88.3
### Description: Update the add-task functionality to integrate with existing validation and error handling mechanisms (from Task 87).
### Details:
Modify the code to provide clear feedback if dependencies cannot be resolved. Ensure that circular dependencies are detected and handled appropriately.

## 5. Optimize Performance for Large Projects [done]
### Dependencies: 88.4
### Description: Optimize the add-task functionality to ensure efficient dependency resolution, especially for projects with a large number of tasks.
### Details:
Profile and optimize the recursive dependency analysis algorithm. Implement caching or other performance improvements as needed.
