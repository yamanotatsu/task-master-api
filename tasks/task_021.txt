# Task ID: 21
# Title: Refactor dev.js into Modular Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Restructure the monolithic dev.js file into separate modular components to improve code maintainability, readability, and testability while preserving all existing functionality.
# Details:
This task involves breaking down the current dev.js file into logical modules with clear responsibilities:

1. Create the following module files:
   - commands.js: Handle all CLI command definitions and execution logic
   - ai-services.js: Encapsulate all AI service interactions (OpenAI, etc.)
   - task-manager.js: Manage task operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - ui.js: Handle all console output formatting, colors, and user interaction
   - utils.js: Contain helper functions, utilities, and shared code

2. Refactor dev.js to serve as the entry point that:
   - Imports and initializes all modules
   - Handles command-line argument parsing
   - Sets up the execution environment
   - Orchestrates the flow between modules

3. Ensure proper dependency injection between modules to avoid circular dependencies

4. Maintain consistent error handling across modules

5. Update import/export statements throughout the codebase

6. Document each module with clear JSDoc comments explaining purpose and usage

7. Ensure configuration and logging systems are properly integrated into each module

The refactoring should not change any existing functionality - this is purely a code organization task.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that functionality remains identical after refactoring:

1. Automated Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each new module to verify individual functionality
   - Implement integration tests that verify modules work together correctly
   - Test each command to ensure it works exactly as before

2. Manual Testing:
   - Execute all existing CLI commands and verify outputs match pre-refactoring behavior
   - Test edge cases like error handling and invalid inputs
   - Verify that configuration options still work as expected

3. Code Quality Verification:
   - Run linting tools to ensure code quality standards are maintained
   - Check for any circular dependencies between modules
   - Verify that each module has a single, clear responsibility

4. Performance Testing:
   - Compare execution time before and after refactoring to ensure no performance regression

5. Documentation Check:
   - Verify that each module has proper documentation
   - Ensure README is updated if necessary to reflect architectural changes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current dev.js Structure and Plan Module Boundaries [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the existing dev.js file to identify logical boundaries for the new modules. Create a detailed mapping document that outlines which functions, variables, and code blocks will move to which module files. Identify shared dependencies, potential circular references, and determine the appropriate interfaces between modules.
### Details:


## 2. Create Core Module Structure and Entry Point Refactoring [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create the skeleton structure for all module files (commands.js, ai-services.js, task-manager.js, ui.js, utils.js) with proper export statements. Refactor dev.js to serve as the entry point that imports and orchestrates these modules. Implement the basic initialization flow and command-line argument parsing in the new structure.
### Details:


## 3. Implement Core Module Functionality with Dependency Injection [done]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Migrate the core functionality from dev.js into the appropriate modules following the mapping document. Implement proper dependency injection to avoid circular dependencies. Ensure each module has a clear API and properly encapsulates its internal state. Focus on the critical path functionality first.
### Details:


## 4. Implement Error Handling and Complete Module Migration [done]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Establish a consistent error handling pattern across all modules. Complete the migration of remaining functionality from dev.js to the appropriate modules. Ensure all edge cases, error scenarios, and helper functions are properly moved and integrated. Update all import/export statements throughout the codebase to reference the new module structure.
### Details:


## 5. Test, Document, and Finalize Modular Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the refactored codebase to ensure all functionality works as expected. Add detailed JSDoc comments to all modules, functions, and significant code blocks. Create or update developer documentation explaining the new modular structure, module responsibilities, and how they interact. Perform a final code review to ensure code quality, consistency, and adherence to best practices.
