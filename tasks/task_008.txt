# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Implementation Drift Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create system to handle changes in implementation that affect future tasks.
# Details:
Implement drift handling including:
- Add capability to update future tasks based on completed work
- Implement task rewriting based on new context
- Create dependency chain updates when tasks change
- Preserve completed work while updating future tasks
- Add command to analyze and suggest updates to future tasks

# Test Strategy:
Simulate implementation changes and test the system's ability to update future tasks appropriately. Verify that completed tasks remain unchanged while pending tasks are updated correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Task Update Mechanism Based on Completed Work [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a system that can identify pending tasks affected by recently completed tasks and update them accordingly. This requires analyzing the dependency chain and determining which future tasks need modification based on implementation decisions made in completed tasks. Create a function that takes a completed task ID as input, identifies dependent tasks, and prepares them for potential updates.

## 2. Implement AI-Powered Task Rewriting [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop functionality to use Claude API to rewrite pending tasks based on new implementation context. This involves creating specialized prompts that include the original task description, the implementation details of completed dependency tasks, and instructions to update the pending task to align with the actual implementation. The system should generate updated task descriptions, details, and test strategies.
### Details:


## 3. Build Dependency Chain Update System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to update task dependencies when task implementations change. This includes adding new dependencies that weren't initially identified, removing dependencies that are no longer relevant, and reordering dependencies based on implementation decisions. The system should maintain the integrity of the dependency graph while reflecting the actual implementation requirements.
### Details:


## 4. Implement Completed Work Preservation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop a mechanism to ensure that updates to future tasks don't affect completed work. This includes creating a versioning system for tasks, tracking task history, and implementing safeguards to prevent modifications to completed tasks. The system should maintain a record of task changes while ensuring that completed work remains stable.
### Details:


## 5. Create Update Analysis and Suggestion Command [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Implement a CLI command that analyzes the current state of tasks, identifies potential drift between completed and pending tasks, and suggests updates. This command should provide a comprehensive report of potential inconsistencies and offer recommendations for task updates without automatically applying them. It should include options to apply all suggested changes, select specific changes to apply, or ignore suggestions.
