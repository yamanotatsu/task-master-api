# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Research-Backed Subtask Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Enhance subtask generation with research capabilities from Perplexity API.
# Details:
Implement research-backed generation including:
- Create specialized research prompts for different domains
- Implement context enrichment from research results
- Add domain-specific knowledge incorporation
- Create more detailed subtask generation with best practices
- Include references to relevant libraries and tools

# Test Strategy:
Compare subtasks generated with and without research backing. Verify that research-backed subtasks include more specific technical details and best practices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Domain-Specific Research Prompt Templates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a set of specialized prompt templates for different software development domains (e.g., web development, mobile, data science, DevOps). Each template should be structured to extract relevant best practices, libraries, tools, and implementation patterns from Perplexity API. Implement a prompt template selection mechanism based on the task context and domain.
### Details:


## 2. Implement Research Query Execution and Response Processing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a module that executes research queries using the Perplexity API integration. This should include sending the domain-specific prompts, handling the API responses, and parsing the results into a structured format that can be used for context enrichment. Implement error handling, rate limiting, and fallback to Claude when Perplexity is unavailable.
### Details:


## 3. Develop Context Enrichment Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create a pipeline that processes research results and enriches the task context with relevant information. This should include filtering irrelevant information, organizing research findings by category (tools, libraries, best practices, etc.), and formatting the enriched context for use in subtask generation. Implement a scoring mechanism to prioritize the most relevant research findings.
### Details:


## 4. Implement Domain-Specific Knowledge Incorporation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Develop a system to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the subtask generation process. This should include identifying key domain concepts, technical requirements, and industry standards from the research results. Create a knowledge base structure that organizes domain information and can be referenced during subtask generation.
### Details:


## 5. Enhance Subtask Generation with Technical Details [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Extend the existing subtask generation functionality to incorporate research findings and produce more technically detailed subtasks. This includes modifying the Claude prompt templates to leverage the enriched context, implementing specific sections for technical approach, implementation notes, and potential challenges. Ensure generated subtasks include concrete technical details rather than generic steps.
### Details:


## 6. Implement Reference and Resource Inclusion [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.5
### Description: Create a system to include references to relevant libraries, tools, documentation, and other resources in generated subtasks. This should extract specific references from research results, validate their relevance, and format them as actionable links or citations within subtasks. Implement a verification step to ensure referenced resources are current and applicable.
