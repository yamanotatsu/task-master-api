# Task ID: 89
# Title: Introduce Prioritize Command with Enhanced Priority Levels
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a prioritize command with --up/--down/--priority/--id flags and shorthand equivalents (-u/-d/-p/-i). Add 'lowest' and 'highest' priority levels, updating CLI output accordingly.
# Details:
The new prioritize command should allow users to adjust task priorities using the specified flags. The --up and --down flags will modify the priority relative to the current level, while --priority sets an absolute priority. The --id flag specifies which task to prioritize. Shorthand equivalents (-u/-d/-p/-i) should be supported for user convenience.

The priority levels should now include 'lowest', 'low', 'medium', 'high', and 'highest'. The CLI output should be updated to reflect these new priority levels accurately.

Considerations:
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing commands and configurations.
- Update the help documentation to include the new command and its usage.
- Implement proper error handling for invalid priority levels or missing flags.

# Test Strategy:
To verify task completion, perform the following tests:
1. Test each flag (--up, --down, --priority, --id) individually and in combination to ensure they function as expected.
2. Verify that shorthand equivalents (-u, -d, -p, -i) work correctly.
3. Check that the new priority levels ('lowest' and 'highest') are recognized and displayed properly in CLI output.
4. Test error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-existent task IDs, invalid priority levels).
5. Ensure that the help command displays accurate information about the new prioritize command.
