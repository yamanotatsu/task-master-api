# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Advanced ContextManager System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive ContextManager class to unify context handling with advanced features like context optimization, prioritization, and intelligent context selection.
# Details:
Building on Phase 1 and Phase 2 context implementations, develop Phase 3 advanced context management:

1. Implement the ContextManager Class:
   - Create a unified `ContextManager` class that encapsulates all context functionality
   - Implement methods for gathering context from all supported sources
   - Create a configurable context priority system to favor more relevant context types
   - Add token management to ensure context fits within API limits
   - Implement caching for frequently used context to improve performance

2. Create Context Optimization Pipeline:
   - Develop intelligent context optimization algorithms
   - Implement type-based truncation strategies (code vs. text)
   - Create relevance scoring to prioritize most useful context portions
   - Add token budget allocation that divides available tokens among context types
   - Implement dynamic optimization based on operation type

3. Add Command Interface Enhancements:
   - Create the `--context-all` flag to include all available context
   - Add the `--context-max-tokens <tokens>` option to control token allocation
   - Implement unified context options across all AI commands
   - Add intelligent default values for different command types

4. Integrate with AI Services:
   - Update the AI service integration to use the ContextManager
   - Create specialized context assembly for different AI operations
   - Add post-processing to capture new context from AI responses
   - Implement adaptive context selection based on operation success

5. Add Performance Monitoring:
   - Create context usage statistics tracking
   - Implement logging for context selection decisions
   - Add warnings for context token limits
   - Create troubleshooting utilities for context-related issues

The ContextManager system should provide a powerful but easy-to-use interface for both users and developers, maintaining backward compatibility with earlier phases while adding substantial new capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and performance of the advanced context management:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test all ContextManager class methods with various inputs
   - Verify optimization algorithms maintain critical information
   - Test caching mechanisms for correctness and efficiency
   - Verify token allocation and budgeting functions
   - Test each context source integration separately

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify ContextManager integration with AI services
   - Test with all AI-related commands
   - Verify backward compatibility with existing context options
   - Test context prioritization across multiple context types
   - Verify logging and error handling

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark context gathering and optimization times
   - Test with large and complex context sources
   - Measure impact of caching on repeated operations
   - Verify memory usage remains acceptable
   - Test with token limits of different sizes

4. Quality Assessment:
   - Compare AI outputs using Phase 3 vs. earlier context handling
   - Measure improvements in context relevance and quality
   - Test complex scenarios requiring multiple context types
   - Quantify the impact on token efficiency

5. User Experience Testing:
   - Verify CLI options are intuitive and well-documented
   - Test error messages are helpful for troubleshooting
   - Ensure log output provides useful insights
   - Test all convenience options like `--context-all`

Create automated test suites for regression testing of the complete context system.
