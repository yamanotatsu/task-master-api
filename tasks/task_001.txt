# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Task Data Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the core tasks.json structure that will serve as the single source of truth for the system.
# Details:
Create the foundational data structure including:
- JSON schema for tasks.json
- Task model with all required fields (id, title, description, status, dependencies, priority, details, testStrategy, subtasks)
- Validation functions for the task model
- Basic file system operations for reading/writing tasks.json
- Error handling for file operations

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the tasks.json structure can be created, read, and validated. Test with sample data to ensure all fields are properly handled and that validation correctly identifies invalid structures.
