# Task ID: 56
# Title: Refactor Task-Master Files into Node Module Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Restructure the task-master files by moving them from the project root into a proper node module structure to improve organization and maintainability.
# Details:
This task involves a significant refactoring of the task-master system to follow better Node.js module practices. Currently, task-master files are located in the project root, which creates clutter and doesn't follow best practices for Node.js applications. The refactoring should:

1. Create a dedicated directory structure within node_modules or as a local package
2. Update all import/require paths throughout the codebase to reference the new module location
3. Reorganize the files into a logical structure (lib/, utils/, commands/, etc.)
4. Ensure the module has a proper package.json with dependencies and exports
5. Update any build processes, scripts, or configuration files to reflect the new structure
6. Maintain backward compatibility where possible to minimize disruption
7. Document the new structure and any changes to usage patterns

This is a high-risk refactoring as it touches many parts of the system, so it should be approached methodically with frequent testing. Consider using a feature branch and implementing the changes incrementally rather than all at once.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this refactoring should be comprehensive to ensure nothing breaks during the restructuring:

1. Create a complete inventory of existing functionality through automated tests before starting
2. Implement unit tests for each module to verify they function correctly in the new structure
3. Create integration tests that verify the interactions between modules work as expected
4. Test all CLI commands to ensure they continue to function with the new module structure
5. Verify that all import/require statements resolve correctly
6. Test on different environments (development, staging) to ensure compatibility
7. Perform regression testing on all features that depend on task-master functionality
8. Create a rollback plan and test it to ensure we can revert changes if critical issues arise
9. Conduct performance testing to ensure the refactoring doesn't introduce overhead
10. Have multiple developers test the changes on their local environments before merging
