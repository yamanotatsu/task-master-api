# Task ID: 45
# Title: Implement GitHub Issue Import Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a '--from-github' flag to the add-task command that accepts a GitHub issue URL and automatically generates a corresponding task with relevant details.
# Details:
Implement a new flag '--from-github' for the add-task command that allows users to create tasks directly from GitHub issues. The implementation should:

1. Accept a GitHub issue URL as an argument (e.g., 'taskmaster add-task --from-github https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123')
2. Parse the URL to extract the repository owner, name, and issue number
3. Use the GitHub API to fetch the issue details including:
   - Issue title (to be used as task title)
   - Issue description (to be used as task description)
   - Issue labels (to be potentially used as tags)
   - Issue assignees (for reference)
   - Issue status (open/closed)
4. Generate a well-formatted task with this information
5. Include a reference link back to the original GitHub issue
6. Handle authentication for private repositories using GitHub tokens from environment variables or config file
7. Implement proper error handling for:
   - Invalid URLs
   - Non-existent issues
   - API rate limiting
   - Authentication failures
   - Network issues
8. Allow users to override or supplement the imported details with additional command-line arguments
9. Add appropriate documentation in help text and user guide

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover the following scenarios:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test URL parsing functionality with valid and invalid GitHub issue URLs
   - Test GitHub API response parsing with mocked API responses
   - Test error handling for various failure cases

2. Integration tests:
   - Test with real GitHub public issues (use well-known repositories)
   - Test with both open and closed issues
   - Test with issues containing various elements (labels, assignees, comments)

3. Error case tests:
   - Invalid URL format
   - Non-existent repository
   - Non-existent issue number
   - API rate limit exceeded
   - Authentication failures for private repos

4. End-to-end tests:
   - Verify that a task created from a GitHub issue contains all expected information
   - Verify that the task can be properly managed after creation
   - Test the interaction with other flags and commands

Create mock GitHub API responses for testing to avoid hitting rate limits during development and testing. Use environment variables to configure test credentials if needed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design GitHub API integration architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a technical design document outlining the architecture for GitHub API integration, including authentication flow, rate limiting considerations, and error handling strategies.
### Details:
Document should include: API endpoints to be used, authentication method (OAuth vs Personal Access Token), data flow diagrams, and security considerations. Research GitHub API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling mechanisms.

## 2. Implement GitHub URL parsing and validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Create a module to parse and validate GitHub issue URLs, extracting repository owner, repository name, and issue number.
### Details:
Handle various GitHub URL formats (e.g., github.com/owner/repo/issues/123, github.com/owner/repo/pull/123). Implement validation to ensure the URL points to a valid issue or pull request. Return structured data with owner, repo, and issue number for valid URLs.

## 3. Develop GitHub API client for issue fetching [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1, 45.2
### Description: Create a service to authenticate with GitHub and fetch issue details using the GitHub REST API.
### Details:
Implement authentication using GitHub Personal Access Tokens or OAuth. Handle API responses, including error cases (rate limiting, authentication failures, not found). Extract relevant issue data: title, description, labels, assignees, and comments.

## 4. Create task formatter for GitHub issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.3
### Description: Develop a formatter to convert GitHub issue data into the application's task format.
### Details:
Map GitHub issue fields to task fields (title, description, etc.). Convert GitHub markdown to the application's supported format. Handle special GitHub features like issue references and user mentions. Generate appropriate tags based on GitHub labels.

## 5. Implement end-to-end import flow with UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.4
### Description: Create the user interface and workflow for importing GitHub issues, including progress indicators and error handling.
### Details:
Design and implement UI for URL input and import confirmation. Show loading states during API calls. Display meaningful error messages for various failure scenarios. Allow users to review and modify imported task details before saving. Add automated tests for the entire import flow.
